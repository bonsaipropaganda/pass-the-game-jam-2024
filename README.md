# Pass the Game Game Jam - README

## Overview
Welcome to the Pass the Game Game Jam! In this collaborative game jam, a group of developers will take turns contributing to a single game project with minimal communication between participants. Our goal is to create a fun and unique game through spontaneous creativity, all while maintaining a few important guidelines to ensure the project runs smoothly.

We will be working in **2D** using the **Godot Engine** with **GDScript** and the **compatibility mode** renderer. Please ensure all code follows the [Official GDScript Style Guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html)
 for consistency.

## How It Works
1. **Turn-based Contributions**: Each developer has 24 hours to make their contribution to the game. Once your turn is up (or if you finish early), you'll pass the "baton" to the next developer, by tagging them in our Discord server to let them know their turn has begun.
2. **Minimal Communication**: There will be no direct coordination between developers beyond the agreed-upon development goals. The fun lies in seeing how the game evolves with each person's input!
3. **Version Control**: We'll use **GitHub** for the project. Developers will push their changes to the **main branch** after each turn. (Be sure to pull the latest version before making any edits.)
4. **Development Goals**: In order to ensure the game is a playable state by the end, or if you're unsure of what to work on during your turn, we have some suggested development goals included in this README.
5. **Game Genre Poll**: To avoid the game’s genre being dictated by the first few developers, we’ll hold a poll before the jam starts to decide on a general genre (e.g., "platformer" vs. "puzzle").

## Guidelines
- **PG-13 Content**: The game should be appropriate for all audiences. **No NSFW content, racism, sexism, or bigotry** will be tolerated.
- **Preserve the Work of Others**: You are free to take the game in whatever direction you choose during your turn, but do **not outright delete mechanics others added**. You can 100% rewrite other people's code and change things. Instead of outright deleting people's mechanics or additions to the game, modify and add onto the general spirit of what others are doing. 
- **Focus on Completion**: While you can focus on any part of the game during your 24-hour window, please leave things in a **finished** or **polished** state, so the next developer can continue building without unnecessary confusion. This means sticking to the GDScript style guide, consistent naming, commenting your code, and keeping your code modular by making use of Godot's scenes and nodes structure.

## Game Jam Details
- **Duration**: The game jam will last for **one month**, with each developer getting a 24-hour window to contribute. You may choose to finish early and pass the turn.
- **Number of Developers**: Our goal is to have **30 developers** participating in this jam.
- **Itch.io**: We’ll track turns using a **game jam page** on itch.io. The game will be uploaded to the **Higgaion Games** itch.io page, and all contributors will be added as equal contributors. This allows everyone to display the game on their itch.io profiles.

## Development Goals
In addition to any changes you make, please try to keep these development goals in mind. Our aim is to ensure the game is complete and playable by the end of the project. These are **suggested guidelines** to help the game progress smoothly, but they are not strict requirements for your turn. Feel free to focus on what interests you most.

| Group of Developers      | Focus                                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Developers 1-8            | Establish the base game, core mechanics, and game concept.            |
| Developers 9-16           | Iterate on existing mechanics and ensure the game has a working game loop. |
| Developers 17-23          | Finalize the game, adding an ending or conclusion (e.g., game over screen, returning to the main menu, or any mechanic that provides a "complete" experience). |
| Developers 24-30          | Polish the game, fix bugs, and enhance overall quality and fun.       |

These goals are simply here to help guide the project to completion. If you feel inspired to work on something else, that’s perfectly fine!
In summary: The first half of the developers can focus on establishing the game. The second half can focus on finishing the game, and the last few developers can focus on polish.


## Have Fun!
This jam is meant to be a creative, collaborative experience. The magic of the project comes from seeing where everyone takes it, so embrace the surprises! Let’s make something awesome together.
